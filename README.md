# Tip-Tracker<br>
I successfully developed the Tip Tracker app from scratch, utilizing only design images as reference.<br>


Functionality:<br>

1.Users can input the total bill amount, select tip percentages, and specify the number of people sharing the bill.<br>
2.Tip percentages are provided as options, and there's an additional input for custom tip amounts.<br>
3.Real-time updates are displayed for tip amount per person and total amount per person as users input values.<br>
4.The app provides feedback if the number of people is set to zero, displaying a message and highlighting the input field.<br>
5.The custom tip input field is highlighted when selected, providing a visual cue to the user.<br>
6.The reset button allows users to clear all inputs and resets the tip percentage options to their default state.<br>
7.The button's background color changes to green (#26c2ad) when valid inputs are provided, signaling that the app is ready to calculate.<br>
