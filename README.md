# Tip-Tracker
I successfully developed the Tip Tracker app from scratch, utilizing only design images as reference.


Functionality:

1.Users can input the total bill amount, select tip percentages, and specify the number of people sharing the bill.
2.Tip percentages are provided as options, and there's an additional input for custom tip amounts.
3.Real-time updates are displayed for tip amount per person and total amount per person as users input values.
4.The app provides feedback if the number of people is set to zero, displaying a message and highlighting the input field.
5.The custom tip input field is highlighted when selected, providing a visual cue to the user.
6.The reset button allows users to clear all inputs and resets the tip percentage options to their default state.
7.The button's background color changes to green (#26c2ad) when valid inputs are provided, signaling that the app is ready to calculate.
